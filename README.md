🛡️ PhishGuardian: AI-Based Phishing Detection – Summary
PhishGuardian is an AI-powered web application designed to detect phishing emails by analyzing both email content and embedded URLs. Built using Python, Flask, and Scikit-learn, it integrates two machine learning models:

TF-IDF + Logistic Regression for email content

Multinomial Naive Bayes for URL classification

The system features a modern web interface and improved GUI with tabbed analysis, color-coded buttons, and enhanced usability. The dataset was expanded to include real-world phishing samples for better accuracy.

Challenges like data variety and GUI clarity were addressed, and the tool lays a strong foundation for future enhancements in phishing defense.
